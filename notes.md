## AstroAugmentations
**Title:**
(Open-Source) Domain Specific Augmentations for your Data Set

**Abstract:**
Across the machine learning field, data augmentations are applied to improve the performance, robustness and generalizability of models. The augmentations implemented most often are optimised for computer science baseline data sets. When we apply data augmentations to our problems, we can and should consider them to be priors which we impose on the structure of our data space. I present domain specific augmentations for machine learning in astronomy and an open source package which can be used to implement them. I present the domain specific augmentations designed for computer vision in radio astronomy.


## Language in Astronomy
**Title:**
Challenging the Language of Astronomical Classifications

**Abstract:**
Classifying objects is a key part of astronomy. How we chose the classifications we use, and what those classifications can convey are open questions. Furthermore, the meaning of the classes which are used by astronomers may not be inherently easy to convey to non-astronomers, which depending on the classifications may hinder both outreach and citizen science. We present early results from an experiment run by the EMU-Zoo collaboration to make radio astronomical classifications more natural and eventually generate a set of plain English phrases which can be used for experts and citizen scientists alike to describe radio astronomical objects.
